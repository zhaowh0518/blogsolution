Publishing a blog post

After authenticating, you can publish new blog entries.

First, create an XML representation of the post to publish. This XML needs to be in the form of an Atom <entry> element, which might look like this:

<entry xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'>
  <title type='text'>Marriage!</title>
  <content type='xhtml'>
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>Mr. Darcy has <em>proposed marriage</em> to me!</p>
      <p>He is the last man on earth I would ever desire to marry.</p>
      <p>Whatever shall I do?</p>
    </div>
  </content>
  <category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="marriage" />
  <category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Mr. Darcy" />
</entry>

Note: Setting a custom author for posts is currently not supported. All new posts will appear as if they were created by the currently authenticated user.

To publish this entry, send it to the blog's post URL as follows. First, place your Atom <entry> element in the body of a new POST request, using the application/atom+xml content type. Then find the blog's post URL in the metafeed by locating the <link> element where the rel attribute ends with #post. The blog's post URL is given as the href attribute of this element, which is in this format:

http://www.blogger.com/feeds/blogID/posts/default

Note: This URL is the same as the URL in the <link rel="service.post"> tag that appears in the <head> section of the human-readable version of the blog.

Blogger creates a blog post using the entry you sent, then returns an HTTP 201 CREATED status code, along with a copy of the new post in the form of an <entry> element. The entry returned is the same one you sent, but it also contains various elements added by Blogger, such as an <id> element.

If your request fails for some reason, Blogger may return a different status code. For information about the status codes, see the Google Data API protocol reference document.
